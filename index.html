<p><h1><strong>Anawangin Cove</strong></h1></p>

  The placid stream that flows directly to the roaring South China Sea is a sight to behold. Through the years, the hidden cove has maintained its beauty and serenity that can be attributed to its remoteness.

  Upon reaching San Antonio, transfer to a tricycle to Barangay San Miguel or Pundaquit, standard rate is P30 per person, you may opt to add some tip since it is quite far.
